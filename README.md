<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Persian Character Fix

Usually there are so many issues with old written Farsi/Persian texts. They contain so many characters which are not really persian and they should be replaced. This app helps you do that in bulk with supervision on each paragraph.



### Built With

The project originally was written by .NET Framework. I tried to migrate to .NET 7 as a playground and have some fun with it which turned out supoer fun.


* MVVM Architecture
* .NET 7
